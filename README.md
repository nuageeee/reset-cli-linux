## Description

Reset-cli is a powerful package that lets you reset a linux system without reinstalling it!
To make this possible, the script, once installed and run, will download your system's base file (the root directory) and copy all the files back into their directories.

In the futur, a GUI made with the Flutter framework will be made to make the procces easier.

## Installation

The documentation will be move to [Wiki Github](https://github.com/nuageeee/reset-linux/wiki).

## Roadmap

This is the early development version. I am currently working on :

- [ ] Possibility to backup file.
- [ ] Add auto backup for shadow and passwd files.
- [ ] Initialize V0.1.0.
- [ ] ~~Create GUI with flutter~~. This will be release later (When the TUI is finished)
- [ ] Import package on pub dart.
